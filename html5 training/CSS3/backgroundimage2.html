HTML was originally designed to be a hypertext system for structuring and sharing linked documents. Early HTML drafts defined tags, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and anchors, to add structure to text-based documents. The first proposal for an HTML specification by the IETF also included the img element to allow graphics to be displayed inline. The first formal HTML specification was HTML 2, based on the early HTML drafts. This specification introduced forms, and defined a small set of interface components to create edit boxes, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown lists. The small set of interface components defined in HTML 2 has hardly changed compared with the set we currently use with HTML 4.01.
